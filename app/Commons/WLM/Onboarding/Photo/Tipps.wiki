==Better Photos for Wikipedia==

For Wikipedia's requirements, often an existing photo is better than no photo at all. Therefore, we are happy about every image submission. However, to place well in the contest, the technical execution and object representation should be coherent.

'''Above all, the subject should be easily recognizable.''' Please also make sure that the photos have a documentary character and should not represent an artistic composition; watermarks and frames are also not desired (see also [[../rules|the rules]]).

For the perfect photo, many technical details can be taken into account in order to '''reproduce the monument as faithfully as possible'''. In any case, the image should be provided in the best possible quality&nbsp;- ideally in the maximum resolution that the camera can provide. 

To give your photos a better chance in the competition and to make them useful in Wikipedia, we have compiled a number of common problems together with tips on how you can improve the quality of your pictures with little effort.

| style="padding:0;" | [[File:Oberschleißheim Kirche Maria Patronin.jpg|160px]] || '''Help! All lines and angles in my picture are crooked!''' || Falling lines occur when the camera is not held horizontally but tilted up or down. Less tilt is therefore a measure. A greater shooting distance also alleviates the problem as far as space allows. || Careful de-skewing with image processing programs like [[:en:Hugin (Software)|Hugin]] or [[:en:ShiftN|]], please do not forget to add margins for dropped parts of the image, but do not overdo de-skewing, as it can lead to unnatural or unrealistic views.

Some of them even "know" the individual distortion characteristics of certain lenses and rectify quite specifically with the help of the data stored with the image.
